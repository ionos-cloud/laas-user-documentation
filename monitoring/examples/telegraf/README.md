# Telegraf (InfluxData)

Telegraf has plugins or integrations to source a variety of metrics directly from the system itâ€™s running on, to pull in metrics from third-party APIs, or even to listen for metrics via a StatsD and Kafka consumer services. It also has output plugins to send metrics to a variety of other datastores, services, and message queues, including InfluxDB, Graphite, OpenTSDB, Datadog, Librato, Kafka, MQTT, NSQ, and many others.
